Of course, you can also select them from the right-click pop-up menu. (Simply right-click anywhere on the screen to open that up.)</p> <p>However, you might want a palette of colors that is a bit more subdued. So, we've included several others from the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines (GNOME HIG). They range from lighter to darker. To select a different palette, you can either:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Bring up the right-click menu and click the drop down for \"Palette\". It will look similar to the image below:</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Use the keyboard shortcut method: <code>Ctrl+/</code> or <code>Shift+Ctrl+/</code>. (This is somewhat glitchy right now and is on the list of things to fix!)</p> </li> </ul> <p>Once you select a different palette you will have a different set of colors associated with <code>Ctrl+1</code> through <code>Ctrl+9</code>. For example, \"GNOME HIG normal\" uses these level 3 colors in order: Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red, Purple, Brown, Light, and Dark.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Personally, I use the \"GNOME HIG normal\" palette as my default while training or doing presentations. It is more subdued than \"Palette\" and offers you the colors in a bit more of a logical order. However, if I require a little more pizazz, then I'll jump over to \"Palette\".</p> <p>Bug</p> <p>Currently, you cannot re-order the palettes by drag-and-drop.

Welcome to this first blog post.</p> <p>I've been hard at work with DOYS3. It's been a fun adventure so far! \ud83d\ude0e</p> <p>Here's what I've been up to:</p> <ul> <li>Configured three versions of DOYS for the various versions of GNOME.</li> <li>Wrote a bash script to automatically install the correct version based on the identified GNOME version. See the Installation Page for more information. </li> <li> <p>Created this documentation site. Thanks to squidfunk and the amazing Material for Mkdocs. I've been using this software for years and it keeps getting better. Check it out!</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Began the process of getting GNOME to officially accept the extension on extensions.gnome.org.</p> </li> </ul> <p>MAIN branch is frozen</p> <p>I froze the main branch until we either: get approval from E.G.O, or a major update is required for GNOMEv48, whichever comes first. The current working branch is E.G.O.-v15.1-alpha which will be merged into main once approval is complete.</p> <p>Looking forward to the alpha version of GNOMEv48 in January. Hoping that we don't have to make too many modifications to the code this time! \ud83d\ude4f</p> <p>That's it. I'll be posting here with anything new that we are working on. Happy Holidays to you! \ud83c\udf89</p>"}]}
