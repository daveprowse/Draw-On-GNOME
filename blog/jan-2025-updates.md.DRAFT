# January 2025 Updates

Greetings my friends. Here's the updates for DOYS:

- Completed the transfer of the original DOYS extension on extensions.gnome.org. [LINK](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1683/draw-on-you-screen/){target="_blank}
- Ran through a linting process and code review of the latest version of DOYS.
- Began the process of getting the latest version of DOYS approved with E.G.O.
- Forked and copied the original GNOME v3.38 to our main repository page on GitHub.
  - Fixed that branch so it works with GNOME v3.24 through V41.
  - Added it to the main script and documented manual installs as well.

!!! warning "MAIN branch is frozen"

    I froze the main branch until we either: get approval from E.G.O, or a major update is required for GNOMEv48, whichever comes first. The current working branch is [E.G.O.-v15.1-alpha](https://github.com/daveprowse/DrawOnYourScreen3/tree/E.G.O.-v15.1-alpha){target="_blank"} which will be merged into main once approval is complete.
